Welcome to PAINITE, an open source website created using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/).

Docusaurus is a static-site generator. It leverages the full power of React to make your site interactive. It provides out-of-the-box documentation features but can be used to create any kind of site (personal website, product, blog, marketing landing pages, etc).

### Install Git:

Git can be installed on the most common operating systems like Windows, Mac, and Linux. In fact, Git comes installed by default on most Mac and Linux machines!

[To know more about installation of Git on various systems visit the official Git website](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)

### Install Node.js:

Node.js is an environment that can run JavaScript code outside of a web browser and is used to write and run server-side JavaScript apps.

> Docusaurus' minimum supported Node.js version is Node 8, but more recent versions will work as well.

Check that you have the minimum required version installed by running the following command:

`node -v`

### Fork the PAINITE Repository and clone it:

`npm install --global docusaurus-init`

2.  Now run the `npm start` command to launch a browser window at [http://localhost:3000.](http://localhost:3000.)
