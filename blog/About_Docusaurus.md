**[Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/)** was first created and released to the public by the **Facebook Open Source team** in 2017. Since then, this project has been used by a large number of the Facebook open source projects and by over 100 external projects.

**[Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/)** is a tool designed to make it easy for teams to publish documentation websites without having to worry about the infrastructure and design details. At its core, all a user has to provide are documentation files written in Markdown, customization of a provided home page written in React, and a few configuration modifications. Docusaurus handles the rest by providing default styles, site formatting, and simple document navigation.

It also provides core website and documentation features out-of-the-box including **_blog support_**, **_internationalization_**, **_search_**, and **_versioning._**
