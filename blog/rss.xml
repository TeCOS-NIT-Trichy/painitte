You can find CTs and end semester question papers on this website. Click on <a href="http://localhost:3000/docs/intro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Academic</a> and Navigate to your department in the sidebar and select your year. Then you can find question papers under the respective subject name.</p><p>Painite is made using <a href="https://docusaurus.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Docusauras 2,</a> a modern static site generator.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="about-docusaurus">About Docusaurus<a href="#about-docusaurus" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to About Docusaurus" title="Direct link to About Docusaurus">​</a></h2><p><strong><a href="https://docusaurus.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Docusaurus</a></strong> was first created and released to the public by the <strong>Facebook Open Source team</strong> in 2017. Since then, this project has been used by a large number of the Facebook open source projects and by over 100 external projects.</p><p><strong><a href="https://docusaurus.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Docusaurus</a></strong> is a tool designed to make it easy for teams to publish documentation websites without having to worry about the infrastructure and design details. At its core, all a user has to provide are documentation files written in Markdown, customization of a provided home page written in React, and a few configuration modifications. Docusaurus handles the rest by providing default styles, site formatting, and simple document navigation.</p><p>It also provides core website and documentation features out-of-the-box including <strong><em>blog support</em></strong>, <strong><em>internationalization</em></strong>, <strong><em>search</em></strong>, and <strong><em>versioning.</em></strong></p><p>To learn more about Docusaurus click the <a href="https://docusaurus.io/blog/2017/12/14/introducing-docusaurus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">link</a> here.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="contribution-guidelines">Contribution Guidelines<a href="#contribution-guidelines" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Contribution Guidelines" title="Direct link to Contribution Guidelines">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-do-i-need-to-know-to-help-">What do I need to know to help 🤔?<a href="#what-do-i-need-to-know-to-help-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What do I need to know to help 🤔?" title="Direct link to What do I need to know to help 🤔?">​</a></h3><p>If you are looking to help to with a code contribution our project, look for tags which you like to work on.
