You can find CTs and end semester question papers on this website. Click on [Academic](https://technical-council-nitt.github.io/painite-tc/docs/intro) and Navigate to your department in the sidebar and select your year. Then you can find question papers under the respective subject name.\\n\\nPaiNITTe is made using [Docusauras 2,](https://docusaurus.io/) a modern static site generator.\\n\\n## About Docusaurus\\n\\n**[Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/)** was first created and released to the public by the **Facebook Open Source team** in 2017. Since then, this project has been used by a large number of the Facebook open source projects and by over 100 external projects.\\n\\n**[Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/)** is a tool designed to make it easy for teams to publish documentation websites without having to worry about the infrastructure and design details. At its core, all a user has to provide are documentation files written in Markdown, customization of a provided home page written in React, and a few configuration modifications. Docusaurus handles the rest by providing default styles, site formatting, and simple document navigation.\\n\\nIt also provides core website and documentation features out-of-the-box including **_blog support_**, **_internationalization_**, **_search_**, and **_versioning._**\\n\\nTo learn more about Docusaurus click the [link](https://docusaurus.io/blog/2017/12/14/introducing-docusaurus) here.\\n\\n## Contribution Guidelines\\n\\n### What do I need to know to help \ud83e\udd14?\\n\\nIf you are looking to help to with a code contribution our project, look for tags which you like to work on. If you are **beginner** and want to do your first contribution check [good first issue](https://github.com/TeCOS-NIT-Trichy/painitte/labels/good%20first%20issue) . If you don\'t feel ready to make a code contribution yet, no problem! You can also check out the documentation issues [`documentation`](https://github.com/TeCOS-NIT-Trichy/painitte/labels/documentation) or the design issues that we have [`design`](https://github.com/TeCOS-NIT-Trichy/painitte/labels/design).\\n\\nIf you are interested in making a code contribution and would like to learn more about open source and the technologies that we use, check out the list below.\\n\\n- https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-contribute-to-open-source-projects-beginners-guide/\\n\\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzeVMecydCE\\n\\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-hYKNgaMmE\\n\\n- https://docusaurus.io/docs\\n\\n### How do I make a contribution \ud83d\ude0e?\\n\\nNever made an open source contribution before? Wondering how contributions work in the in our project? Here\'s a quick rundown!\\n\\n#### Set-Up:\\n\\n- **Fork** the repository associated with the issue to your local GitHub organization from [`https://github.com/TeCOS-NIT-Trichy/painitte`](https://github.com/TeCOS-NIT-Trichy/painitte). This means that you will have a copy of the repository under **Your-GitHub-Username/painite**.\\n\\n- Clone the repository to your local machine using **git clone [https://github.com/<_YOUR_USERNAME_>/painitte.git](https://github.com/github-username/repository-name.git)**.\\n\\n- Now you will have a local repo of this project saved in your system.\\n\\n- Open the project in VS Code (or your preffered IDE).\\n\\n- Run `npm install` or `npm i` to install all the neccessary dependencies for the project.\\n\\n- Run `npm start` to run the project locally.\\n\\n- Now you can visit your local build at `http://localhost:3000`.\\n\\n- Create a new branch for your fix using the command `git checkout -b branch-name-here`.\\n\\n- Make the appropriate changes for the issue you are trying to address or the feature that you want to add.\\n\\n### Contributing the Project:\\n\\nYou can make a contribution towards PainiTTe in either of the 2 ways mentioned below \ud83d\udc47.\\n\\n#### Using Github:\\n\\n1. Find an issue that you are interested in addressing or a feature that you would like to add.\\n\\n2. Use `git add insert-paths-of-changed-files-here` to add the file contents of the changed files to the \\"snapshot\\" git uses to manage the state of the project, also known as the index.\\n\\n3. Use `git commit -m \\"Insert a short message of the changes made here\\"` to store the contents of the index with a descriptive message.\\n\\n4. Push the changes to the remote repository using **git push origin branch-name-here**.\\n\\n5. Submit a **pull request** to the upstream repository.\\n\\n6. **Title** the pull request with a short description of the changes made and the issue or bug number associated with your change. For **example**, you can title an issue like so **\\"Added more log outputting to resolve #4352\\"**.\\n\\n7. In the **description** of the pull request, explain the changes that you made, any issues you think exist with the pull request you made, and any questions you have for the maintainer. It\'s OK if your pull request is not perfect (no pull request is), the reviewer will be able to help you fix any problems and improve it!\\n\\n8. Wait for the pull request to be reviewed by a maintainer.\\n\\n9. Make changes to the pull request if the reviewing maintainer recommends them.\\n\\n10. Celebrate your success \ud83e\udd73 after your pull request is merged!\\n\\n#### Gforms:\\n\\nYou can also contribute to **PainiTTe** website through Gforms \ud83e\udd14. You just need to **upload** the **questions papers** or any **resources (notes, pdf, images)** in the Gform and we will add those question papers to the website\u270c\ufe0f.\\n\\nGform link - [https://forms.gle/eeM28bcrvYSvDRKn9](https://forms.gle/eeM28bcrvYSvDRKn9)\\n\\n### Where can I go for help \ud83e\udd28?\\n\\nIf you need help, you can ask questions on our [whatsapp](https://chat.whatsapp.com/CQ0LXqibJjCESfdnWrIbRR) group.\\n\\n### What does the Code of Conduct \u2696\ufe0f mean for me ?\\n\\nOur **Code of Conduct** means that you are responsible for treating everyone on the project with respect and courtesy regardless of their identity.
